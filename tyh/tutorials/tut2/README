All the files with names starting with "Testxxx" is for testing
Only "TestLib.java" and "TestLib2.java" are using Java's library's linkedlist, while all the 
other testing files are using our own version of linkedlist, starting with BasicLinkedList, then
ExtendedLinkedList, then TailedLinkedList, then CircularLinkedList....
