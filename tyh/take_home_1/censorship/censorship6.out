Whatever goes upon two **** is an enemy Whatever goes upon four **** or has ***** is a friend And remember also that in fighting against man we must not come to resemble him Even when you have ********* him do not adopt his vices No ****** must ever live in a house or sleep in a bed or wear ******* or drink ******* or smoke ******* or touch ***** or engage in ***** All the habits of man are **** And above all no ****** must ever tyrannize over his own kind Weak or strong clever or simple we are all brothers No ****** must ever kill any other ****** All animals are equal
